# Logic.ly-Overture-CPU

------- COMPLETE ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my implementation of the OVERTURE CPU architecture from the game Turing Complete.
Be warned that it will be laggy, and possibly buggy.

You will find one file containing the processor in this repository - ***Fixed CPU FINAL (17)*** - and a folder - *Programs* - which details programming the processor.
Within *Programs*, you will find the *Programming Guide* folder and the *Program Component* folder.

The *Programming Guide* folder documents setup for the processor and keywords in the OVERTURE assembly lang, as well as providing a Python Repl.it program to convert OVERTURE assembly into machine code.
The *Program Component* folder contains the component used to program the processor as well as some example programs as a guideline.

I started work on the project on the broken CPU on 22/12/23, and finished on 23/12/23, spending a total of 7 hours and 13 minutes working on the project.
I started work on the fix on 08/01/24, and finished on 11/01/24.

Thank you so much for checking out my first project!
