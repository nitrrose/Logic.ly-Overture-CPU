# Logic.ly-Overture-CPU

This is my implementation of the OVERTURE CPU architecture from the game Turing Complete.
Be warned that it will be laggy, and possibly buggy.

You will find three files in this repository: *Program Component FINAL.logicly*, *CPU FINAL (22).logicly*, and Replit-Link.md.  
These are the main files used to program and run the processor.

All information for programming and generating machine code, as well as running the processor is found in *Replit-Link.md*.  
The component used to create programs is found in *Program Component FINAL.logicly*.  
The actual processor is found in *CPU FINAL (22).logicly*.  

Please read the info section at the bottom of the info spreadsheet in *Replit-Link.md*, where it documents how to start the processor, write your assembly code and implement your program.
Additionally, I have added a replit file used to convert OVERTURE assembly code into its machine code counterpart.  
Both can be found in *Replit-Link.md*.

I started work on the project on the 22/12/23, and finished on the 23/12/23, spending a total of 7 hours and 13 minutes working on the project.  

Thank you so much for checking my first project out!
