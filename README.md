# Logic.ly-Overture-CPU

This is my implementation of the OVERTURE CPU architecture from the game Turing Complete.
Be warned that it will be laggy, and possibly buggy.

You will find one file containing the processor in this repository - ***placeholder*** - and a folder - *Programs* - which details programming of the processor.
Within *Programs*, you will find the *Programming Guide* folder and the *Program Component* folder.

The *Programming Guide* folder documents setup for the processor and keywords in the OVERTURE assembly lang, as well as providing a Python Repl.it program to convert OVERTURE assembly into machine code.
The *Program Component* folder contains the component used to program the processor as well as an example program *ADD 5* as a guideline.

I started work on the project on the 22/12/23, and finished on the 23/12/23, spending a total of 7 hours and 13 minutes working on the project.  

Thank you so much for checking out my first project!
