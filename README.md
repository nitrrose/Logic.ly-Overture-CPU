# Logic.ly-Overture-CPU

This is my implementation of the OVERTURE CPU architecture from the game Turing Complete.
Be warned that it will be laggy, and possibly buggy.

You will find three files in this repository: *Program Component FINAL.logicly*, *OVERTURE CPU opcodes + info.pdf*, and *CPU FINAL (22).logicly*.
These are the main files used to program and run the processor.

All information for programming and running the processor is found in *OVERTURE CPU opcodes + info.pdf*.
The component used to create programs is found in *Program Component FINAL.logicly*.
The actual processor is found in *CPU FINAL (22).logicly*.

Please read the info section at the bottom of *OVERTURE CPU opcodes + info.pdf*, where it documents how to start the processor and implement your program.

Additionally, I have added a replit file used to convert OVERTURE assembly code into its machine code counterpart.

I started work on the project on the 22/12/23, and finished on the 23/12/23, spending a total of 7 hours and 13 minutes working on the project.
Thank you so much for checking my first project out!
